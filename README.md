# Cross24 - DevGram

Hi everyone, for today's hackathon we present devgram. Fully developed by students, this app helps young techies fit-in in the world of technology. 

we offer solutions like:  
1. Chat and communication
2. Profile system
3. Blogging system
4. Discussions / Forum
5. Events notification / Search for opportunities
6. Teaming / Team recruitement

These features helps a lot to students. As students ourself, we know what we need.

**Unfortunately, As time was less we couldnt make a full application. We couldn't make a good client application as we focused on the backend logic more. we are sorry to say that we couldnt submit the client side code.. but the node.js RESTapi server is working**

But anyway our nodejs server can do these:


1. Open a chat between 2 users and store in db. We also use websockets for faster communication.
2. Make new accounts, login to them through email/password, login to them using JWT
3. Write a blog, read a blog, Get all blogs
4. start a new question/discussion, answer them, comment on them, get all discussions, get a specific discussion.
5. Get a specific profile, Set a profile, get all registered profiles

We look forward to finish this project with a really good UI and user-friendly app. we would be happy to inform you when its done and also request for a review.

Thanks
